# Question

In your own words, what is React and what are the benefits of using it?

# Answer

React is a library that provides us the ability to create and maintain code through the use of components. Components make up the user interface and each of them has its own looks and purpose. The perks of using React is the code is reusable, can be combined with other code, and can support a growing user base. This makes our code more flexible overall.
