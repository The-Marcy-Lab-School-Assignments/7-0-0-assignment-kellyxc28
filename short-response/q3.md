# Question

What happens when the setter function returned by `useState` is invoked?

# Answer

When the setter function is invoked, values are not being changed. Instead, the component that had changes made to it is being rendered again.

# Teacher Feedback

The values are being changed. Every time we use the setter function, the state gets updated as well and the component that has that state is re-rendered.
